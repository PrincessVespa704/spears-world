      <p>
        ACME STUNTS FOR COYOTES and its subsidiary, ACME Data Boulders, is pleased to
        announce a new partnership with Roadrunner Pharmaceuticals Hotline and Pharmaceuticals. This
        new alliance will improve, enhance, and innovate the pharmaceutical
        market by streamlining the process from receiving a prescription to
        receiving the medication at home.
      </p>

      <p>
        Roadrunner Pharmaceuticals Hotline and Pharmaceuticals teamed up with ACME Data Boulders to
        improve the prescription process as an experiment in 2024. Today, the
        experiment was declared a success as now patients, doctors, health
        insurance, pharmacists, and others involved in the prescription issuing
        process can communicate with one another via a single channel, saving
        time and numerous phone calls. The application limits access to each
        party involved based on their part in the process, while providing
        avenues to communicate to everyone else. There are options to add
        copayment programs and family members who are assisting loved ones with
        the process.
      </p>

      <p>
        This innovation was funded by donations as well as by ACME STUNTS FOR COYOTES and
        Roadrunner Pharmaceuticals Hotline and Pharmaceuticals and more innovations beyond the
        pharmaceutical industry are expected from this partnership in the years
        ahead. Roadrunner Pharmaceuticals Hotline and Pharmaceuticals will be featuring some of its
        products and branded gear in the ACME STUNTS FOR COYOTES store within the next few
        months.
      </p>

      <p>
        CEO of Roadrunner Pharmaceuticals Hotline and Pharmaceuticals, Wile E. Coyote added, "We will
        finally catch the roadrunner of all roadrunners - teamwork makes the
        dream work."

        <h2>Who We Are:</h2>
          <p>
            Formed originally in 2014 as a subsidiary of the now defunct Winter Hill
            Companies, ACME Data Boulders became its own independent company in
            2020. It's growth expanded beyond offering co-location services. In
            2025, ACME Data Boulders added a parent company to meet the needs of its
            clients - creating an one-stop-shop for services and for products
            including the world-famous ACME STUNTS FOR COYOTES Soundbar, a speaker that can not
            only play sounds from movies and music from a variety of sources, it can
            also serve as a morse code and ham radio receiver. While ACME STUNTS FOR COYOTES
            sells equipment and fun gear for fans, ACME Data Boulders remains the
            trusted source for consistent, effective, and constant service for
            co-location and now web-hosting.
