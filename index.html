        <h3><pre>
            Michael K Spears, founder and CEO of Spearsworld and its subsidiary, Spearware Networks, is pleased to announce a new partnership with ACME Networks and Pharmaceuticals. This new alliance will improve,
            enhance, and innovate the pharmaceutical market by streamlining the process from receiving a prescription to receiving the medication at home. 
          
            Acme Networks and Pharmaceuticals teamed up with Spearware Networks to improve the prescription process as an experiment in 2024. Today, the experiment was declared a success as now patients, doctors,
            health insurance, pharmacists, and others involved in the prescription issuing process can communicate with one another via a single channel, saving time and numerous phone calls. The application 
            limits access to each party involved based on their part in the process, while providing avenues to communicate to everyone else. There are options to add copayment programs and family members who are 
            assisting loved ones with the process.
          
            This innovation was funded by donations as well as by Spearsworld and ACME Networks and Pharmaceuticals and more innovations beyond the pharmaceutical industry are expected from this partnership in 
            the years ahead. Acme Networks and Pharmaceuticals will be featuring some of its products and branded gear in the Spearsworld store within the next few months. 

            CEO of ACME Networks and Pharmaceuticals, Wile E. Coyote added, "We will finally catch the roadrunner of all roadrunners - teamwork makes the dream work."
          
            Formed originally in 2014 as a subsidiary of the now defunct Winter Hill Companies, Spearware Networks became its own independent company in 2020. It's growth expanded beyond offering co-location
            services. In 2025, Spearware Networks added a parent company to meet the needs of its clients - creating an one-stop-shop for services and for products including the world-famous Spearsworld
            Soundbar, a speaker that can not only play sounds from movies and music from a variety of sources, it can also serve as a morse code and ham radio receiver. While Spearsworld sells equipment 
            and fun gear for fans, Spearware Networks remains the trusted source for consistent, effective, and constant service for co-location and now web-hosting.
