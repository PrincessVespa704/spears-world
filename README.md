# <ACME STUNTS FOR COYOTES>

## Description

This website is a first attempt at creating a webpage using HTML5 and CSS. I have previously edited earlier versions of HTML in my career and "flew by the seat of my pants" with editing. I didn't completely know or understand the rules. This project was meant to be a fun way to reinforce what I have learned about the rules and formatting during class and to learn a bit more about myself and my abilities. The ACME STUNTS FOR COYOTES page addresses several concerns that I had for myself and my ability to learn: rules/formatting as mentioned earlier; can I actually build a page from scratch; can the page be pretty; and am I resourceful and smart enough to continue with this class.

What did I learn? I'm resourceful and am a bit "messy". While I was able to create a PHP form and edit it, the rest of coding was a hodge/podge (or spaghetti). I was working on both HTML and CSS at the same time. Moving forward, it's important to work on the foundation (HTML) then add the pretty stuff (CSS). Working on both opens me up to errors and confusion in my work for both me and for anyone looking at the code later on. When in CSS, I need to be better organized in labeling sections as related to HTML so I can find what needs to be edited quickly rather than searching through the entire page. By following the rules/formatting guidelines, I'll be in a better position to build a much better site in the future and to work on future class projects more efficiently and effectively. I definitely need to review previous classes and notes.

On a personal note, I had wondered if I was capable of doing this. I can - even though I need a lot of help right now. That is a huge confidence builder, especially since I'm understanding more of what I'm doing. I am thankful and grateful for this opportunity to learn. Yes, we are not ever too old to learn something new!
